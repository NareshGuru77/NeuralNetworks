## This task is to understand CNNs..

* Goal is to implement a CNN to classify images of A and B without using deep learning libraries..

* This constraint of not using deep learning libraries, would help understand CNN better..

* The notebook now just loads the data using numpy and PIL..

* The notMNIST_small.tar.gz file when needs to be extracted and put in the same location as the notebook...
